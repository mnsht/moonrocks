# Moonrocks

Just another UI component library based on [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/).

## Developing

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`

## Using

_Need to work on this section..._

1. Run `yarn add moonrocks react-icons react-router-dom` in your app
2. Add a `<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>` to your project's root, and pass it a theme. You can either add your own theme or import the one used in this library like such: `import { theme } from 'moonrocks';`. We also export `ThemeProvider` from styled-components, which is bundled in the library.
3. To import a component in a file, simply type `import { Box } from 'moonrocks';`
4. GG.
