## Using

_Need to work on this section..._

1. Run `yarn add https://github.com/cereallarceny/src.git` in your app
2. Add a `<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>` to your project's root, and pass it a theme. You can either add your own theme or import the one used in this library like such: `import { theme } from '@cereallarceny/src';`. We also export `ThemeProvider` from styled-components, which is bundled in the library.
3. To import a component in a file, simply type `import { Box } from '@cereallarceny/src';`
